Hi! I am Elizabeth.  I'm relatively new to dragon training and have yet to enter the apprentice competitions.  I started with an older dragon from the Himalays named Dhaulagiri.  She was a gentle soul, but alas she retired and I am now working with a young Makalu from Transivania.  He is a handsome stud and very eger to please. My dragon master says he should be ready to compete within two years.
